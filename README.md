## ðŸŒŸ What I Learned

- **Loops (`while` loop):** How to keep the game going until the one is the winner.
- **Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`):** How to check if the guess is correct.
- **Python's `random` Library:** To make the game interesting by having the computer pick a random item every time.
- **Input and Output:** Getting the player's guess and showing messages.
